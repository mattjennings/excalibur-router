# Excalibur Router

A scene router for [Excalibur](https://excaliburjs.com).

## Features

- Transitions
- Dynamic scene loading
- Loading scenes

## Usage

```
npm install excalibur-router
```

```js
import * as ex from 'excalibur'
import { Router } from 'excalibur-router'

const engine = new ex.Engine({
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
})

class Level1 extends ex.Scene {}
class Level2 extends ex.Scene {}

const router = new Router({
  routes: {
    level1: Level1,
    level2: Level2,
  },
})

router.start(engine).then(() => {
  router.goto('level1')
})
```

## Loaders

Router repurposes Loaders to act as scenes. Resources can be loaded using `router.addResource(resources)` and they will be loaded automatically during scene navigation.

When loading, the router temporarily navigates to the loading scene and continues to the target once loading has completed. Router has a default loading scene, but you can provide your own:

```js
class LoadingScene extends ex.Scene {
  // if true, navigation will not resume until this scene emits a 'complete' event
  // it is false by default
  defer = false

  onLoadStart() {}

  onLoad(progress: number) {}

  onLoadComplete() {
    // if this.defer is true:
    this.emit('complete', undefined)
  }
}

const router = new Router({
  routes: {...},
  loader: LoadingScene,
})
```

You can have multiple loaders as well:

```js
const router = new Router({
  routes: {...},
  loader: {
    boot: BootLoadingScene,
    // default will be used if no loader is provided in router.goto()
    default: LoadingScene
  },
})

router.goto('level1', {
  loader: 'boot'
})
```

## Dynamic Scene Loading

Scenes can be imported dynamically as routes, which will then trigger a loading scene when navigated to. If these scenes contain any `router.addResource()` calls or import files that do, they will get loaded in the same loading screen.

```js
import * as ex from 'excalibur'
import { Router } from 'excalibur-router'

const engine = new ex.Engine({
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
})

const router = new Router({
  routes: {
    level1: () => import('./level1'), // contains default export of scene
    level2: () => import('./level2'),
  },
})

router.start(engine).then(() => {
  router.goto('level1')
})
```

## Transitions

Transitions are actors with lifecycle hooks for the transitioning of scenes. They typically will play the outro, be carried into the next scene, play their intro, and then be killed.

```js
import { Transition, TransitionArgs } from 'excalibur-router'

export class FadeTransition extends Transition {
  el: ScreenElement

  constructor(args: TransitionArgs = {}) {
    super({
      duration: 300,
      z: Infinity,
      ...args,
    })
  }

  onInitialize(engine: Engine): void {
    this.el = new ScreenElement({
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      z: this.z,
      width: engine.canvasWidth,
      height: engine.canvasHeight,
      color: Color.Black,
    })

    this.el.graphics.opacity = this.isOutro ? 0 : 1
    this.addChild(this.el)
  }

  onIntroStart() {
    this.el.graphics.opacity = 1
  }

  onOutroStart() {
    this.el.graphics.opacity = 0
  }

  onIntro(progress: number) {
    this.el.graphics.opacity = 1 - progress
  }

  onOutro(progress: number) {
    this.el.graphics.opacity = progress
  }
}
```

They can be used in `router.goto`

```js
router.goto('level1', {
  transition: new FadeTransition(),
})
```

There are some default transition effects provided:

- FadeTransition
- CrossFadeTransition

### Transitions with Loading Scenes

Depending on the transition effect, you may want the transition to carry into a loading scene. Transitions can take `persistOnLoading` argument to do this, causing the effect to stay in its completed "outro" state for the entirety of the loading scene.

**Note** This does not apply for the initial loading scene

```js
router.goto('level1', {
  transition: new Fade({
    persistOnLoading: true,
  }),
})
```

You can also provide a number value instead, which will persist the transition for that amount of time in ms before "introing" into the loading scene. This is useful for something like a Fade effect, where you might want to stay faded unless the loading is taking a long time.

```js
router.goto('level1', {
  transition: new Fade({
    // if loading takes longer than 200ms, fade back in to show loading scene
    persistOnLoading: 200,
  }),
})
```
